     *   <li>`transformstart` - starts the touch-based zooming of the visualization</li>
     *   <li>`transform` - touch-based zooming of the visualization</li>
     *   <li>`transformend` - completes the touch-based zooming of the visualization, corrects the view port in such a way that the edge of the visualization touches the edge of the viewport. If the last transformation scale was lower than 0.8 and the zooming was performed with three or more fingers, triggers reset of the visualization view.</li>

     * @param event the details of the event to trigger. The object must contain all the properties of the low-level event, apart from the preventDefault() method.
     *
     * @remarks Heads up!
     * Initiating events using the trigger method will notify all the involved event listeners. For example, triggering the `click` event will invoke the `onGroupClick` listeners and, if the default action is not prevented by that listener, the `onGroupSelectionChanging` and the `onGroupSelectionChanged` events.
     *
     * For this reason, calling the trigger method in event listeners may lead to the visualization falling in an endless loop.
