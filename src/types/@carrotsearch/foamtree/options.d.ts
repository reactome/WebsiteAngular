You can use this option to increase the resolution at which the visualization is drawn to make the image clearer and labels more legible. You can also decrease this resolution to make rendering faster at the cost of quality.
       *
       * By default, pixelRatio is 1. In such cases, the width and height of the canvas on which the visualization is drawn will be equal to the pixel dimensions of the HTML container element. For pixelRatio values greater/smaller than 1, the pixel dimensions of the canvas will be smaller/larger than the dimensions of the enclosing HTML element and the canvas will be stretched to fit in the container's client area. For example, if you set pixelRatio to 2 and if the size of the enclosing HTML element is 400x400 pixels, the size of the canvas will be 800x800 pixels. Such a configuration will better utilize the extra pixels available on Retina displays, for example.
